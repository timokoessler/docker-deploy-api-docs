title: Revoke Deploy Token
---

If a deploy token is compromised or you don't need it anymore, you can revoke it. This will make the token invalid and it can't be used anymore to deploy containers.

## Steps to revoke a deploy token

To open the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it docker-deploy-api cli
```

Then select the option "Revoke a Deploy Toke" and press enter.
After that the wizard asks you to paste the deploy token you want to revoke.
If the token is valid, not expired and not already revoked, it will be revoked and you will get a success message.
After that you need to restart the Docker Deploy API container for this to take effect.

```bash

‚àö What do you want to do? ¬∑ Revoke a Deploy Token
‚àö Please paste or enter the token you want to revoke ¬∑ v4.public.abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890
‚úî Token successfully revoked. You need to restart the Docker Deploy API container for this to take effect
```

:::tip
You can revoke all issued tokens by deleting the file `key.pem` in the `/data` directory. After that you need to restart the Docker Deploy API container to generate a new key pair.

## Technical Details

The Docker Deploy API stores a `sha512` hash of the revoked tokens in a file called `revoked-tokens.json` in the `/data` directory.
