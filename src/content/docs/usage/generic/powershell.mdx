title: PowerShell Script
---

Every instance of the Docker Deploy API hosts a PowerShell script that can be used for easy deployment on Windows. The script is available at `https://deploy.example.com/pwsh`.

## Usage

Replace `deploy.example.com` with the URL of your instance and `DEPLOY_TOKEN` with your deploy token.

```powershell "deploy.example.com" "DEPLOY_TOKEN"
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://deploy.example.com/pwsh))) DEPLOY_TOKEN
```

:::caution
Some antivirus software may block the execution of the above command. If you encounter this issue, you can download the script on your own and execute it locally.
