title: Bash Script
---

Every instance of the Docker Deploy API hosts a Bash script that can be used for easy deployment. The script is available at `https://deploy.example.com/s`.
The script is also used in the CI/CD guides and uses curl to send a POST request to the API.

## Usage

Replace `deploy.example.com` with the URL of your instance and `DEPLOY_TOKEN` with your deploy token.

```bash "deploy.example.com" "\"DEPLOY_TOKEN\""
curl -sSL "https://deploy.example.com/s" | bash -s -- "DEPLOY_TOKEN"
```
