This page will guide you through the installation process of this application.

:::note[Requirements]
The following instructions assume that you have already installed Docker and Docker Compose on your server.
If not, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official documentation</a> for more information.

This software is still a work in progress and not released yet.

## Get docker-compose.yml

First, create a new directory for the application and download the latest `docker-compose.yml` file from the repository.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="curl">
    ```bash title="Download docker-compose.yml" frame="terminal"
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timokoessler/docker-deploy-api/main/docker-compose.yml --output docker-compose.yml
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="wget">
    ```bash title="Download docker-compose.yml" frame="terminal"
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timokoessler/docker-deploy-api/main/docker-compose.yml
    ```  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure the application

Open the `docker-compose.yml` file in your favorite editor and adjust the following settings:

```diff lang="yaml"
...
    ports:
        # Always use a reverse proxy like nginx to proxy the requests to this container
-        - '127.0.0.1:8080:3000'
+        - '127.0.0.1:8081:3000' # Change to a non public unused port
    environment:
-        - URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 # Public url of the api
+        - URL=https://deploy.example.com # Your public url
        - PORT=3000 # The port the api is listening on (inside the container)
...
```

Change the `URL` to the public url of your application and modify the `ports` setting to a non public port that is not used by another application on your server.
You can also use Docker networks to communicate with the container from other containers.

:::tip
You can find all available configuration options on the [configuration page](/advanced/config).
:::

## Configure the reverse proxy

The application is designed to be used behind a reverse proxy like nginx, that handles the tls termination and proxies the requests to the application.
You can find example proxy configurations on the page [Reverse Proxy](/getting-started/reverse-proxy).

## Start the application

Finally, start the application with the following command:
```bash frame="terminal"
docker compose up -d
```

Make sure the container is not restarting and check the logs for any errors:
```bash frame="terminal"
docker compose logs -f
```

If you open the url of your application in your browser, you should see a welcome page.
Congratulations, you have successfully installed the application! ðŸŽ‰
