Let's say you build a Docker image for your application using a CI/CD pipeline and upload the image to a Docker registry.
But how do you update the running containers on your servers with the new image? You can use Docker Deploy API to do that.

## Features

- Pull new image and recreate container, or only recreate or restart a container
- Update multiple containers at once 🔄️
- Clean up old images 🧹
- Works with private Docker registries 🔒
- No need to give your CI/CD pipeline SSH access to your servers 🛡️
- Works without any database
- Support for nearly any CI/CD pipeline, e.g. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.

## How it works

Docker Deploy API is a HTTP API that you can call from your CI/CD pipeline. The request contains a deploy token that you can generate using the CLI tool.
This token is used to authenticate the request and contains the configuration for the deployment.
For convenience, there is a bash script that you can use in your CI/CD pipeline for sending the request.
