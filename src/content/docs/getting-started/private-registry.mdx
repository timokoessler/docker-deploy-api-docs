title: Private Registry Authentication

Pulling images from a private container registry is a bit more complicated than pulling from a public registry, because the authentication information must be provided.
There are two ways to do this:

## Docker Config

By default the Docker Container will mount the `~/.docker/config.json` file into the container.
If that file contains the authentication information for the registry, the container will be able to pull images from the registry.

:::caution
This is normally not working with Docker Desktop, because the credentials are stored in an external credential store.
:::

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
...
volumes:
  - '~/.docker/config.json:/home/node/.docker/config.json:ro'
...
```

If you start the container with a mounted `config.json` file and an external credential store is used, a warning will be displayed in the logs.

## Add credentials via CLI

It is also possible to add login data for a registry via the CLI. It is stored in a file called `registry-auth.json` in data volume of the container.

To open the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it docker-deploy-api cli
```
Then select the option "Add registry login data and press enter. After that you will be asked for the registry URL, username and password.

```bash
